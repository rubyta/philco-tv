                <p>We are two students who agreed working together in this project as our first project in Web Authoring Fundamental course. We were excited when we got this project. We share our ideas and build it in the way we want it. We learn lots of things from this course. We want to say thank you to Scott McCrindle for teaching us how to make beautiful web. </p>
            <h3>Why we choose Predicta&reg; TV?</h3>
        		<p>we were searching about vintage products, and we came with conclusion to choose Predicta&reg; TV. This product has futuristic and unique design in the odd time when we see it. Then we were searching the official website for the product. It was horrible site for us, so we want to make it looks better than the original site just for this project.</p>
